title: Back to the blogging world

Hello dear foreign (or polyglot) visitor. Long time ago I used to blog, but only in brazilian portuguese. That's my first attempt to write interesting stuff in other languages.

Not every post will be written in all the languages, but I promise I'll try to publish often to almost all.

After testing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) I've chosen Jekyll. At first I was looking for everything translated (e.g. dates), no additional plugins needed, a certain URL pattern, etc. I've given up on some things, I've customized a theme and here we are.

Everything is quite simple and from now on I'll make a few changes.

I do not intend to write only about technology and geek stuff. I'll write about some other topics.

By now that's all folks!
